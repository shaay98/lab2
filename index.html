          snow. Last minute holiday travel could be impacted by rain, possible
          snow moving in Wednesday night. Clouds will be with us much of the day
          ahead of our next system. Rain and snow showers will overspread the
          area Wednesday night with primarily rain for the Pittsburgh area.
          However, snow could drop a slushy inch or two of snow along and north
          of the I-80 corridor by Thursday morning creating slippery conditions
          in those areas for Thanksgiving morning.
